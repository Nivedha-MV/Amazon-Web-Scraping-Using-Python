# Amazon-Web-Scraping-Using-Python
Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. In this project, the script takes a specified Amazon product page URL as input and scrapes the name and price of the items listed on that page. The data is then saved into a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, which is a common format for storing tabular data.
